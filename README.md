# RvF - Real vs Fake Face Detection

Deepfakes are everywhere now, and like us you're probably wondering ["wow how am I going to figure out if that video of Morgan Freeman telling me he isn't real, is actually real?"](https://youtu.be/oxXpB9pSETo). While a true deepfake detector is too complicated for a single semester, we're going to do something a little bit easier - try and determine whether a picture of a face is fake or not. You'll definitely enjoy this project if you want to learn about neural networks, computer vision, and figuring out if your friend keeps Photoshopping their Instagram posts.

**Skills Learned**: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, PyTorch, TensorFlow
